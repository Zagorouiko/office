This application is meant to fulfill the requirements of an assignment through Epicodus code school. For more information on Epicodus, see <http://www.epicodus.com/>.

### Description ###

The application is a prototype for an an application that might be offered by an office supply company or multi-office building management to consolidate office supply purchases in order to qualify for bulk quantity discounts.

E.g., company A in suite 101 order 200 ink pens, and company B in suite 202 order 400 ink pens. The office supply co. offers a discount at 500 pens for delivery to a single address - so by combining the two orders into one, both companies benefit from reduced supply costs.
